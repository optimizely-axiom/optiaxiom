# `@optiaxiom/globals`

Design tokens and shared React contexts for Axiom.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @optiaxiom/globals
```

## Usage

This package contains design tokens and shared React contexts used by `@optiaxiom/react`. It's primarily intended for advanced use cases like module federation, where the globals package should be shared across federated modules (similar to React itself).

**Note:** Most developers will never need to install or use this package directly. It's automatically included when you install `@optiaxiom/react`.

### Module Federation

For module federation configuration, see our [Module Federation guide](https://optimizely-axiom.github.io/optiaxiom/guides/module-federation/).
