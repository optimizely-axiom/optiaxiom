# Test Environments

Axiom should work out of the box with most testing libraries. But certain test environments may require custom configuration to work.

## Global provider

### Wrap tests in AxiomProvider

Always make sure to wrap your elements with AxiomProvider during tests.

For example if you're using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) then you should export a custom render function that sets `AxiomProvider` as the default `wrapper`.

```ts
import { AxiomProvider } from "@optiaxiom/react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";


const customRender = (...args: Parameters<typeof render>) => ({
  ...render(args[0], {
    wrapper: AxiomProvider,
    ...args[1],
  }),
});

export * from "@testing-library/react";
export { customRender as render };
```

### Disable animations

Running animations during unit tests can cause unpredictable test results or force developers to write more code waiting for animations to finish. Instead a better strategy is to disable animations during unit tests to ensure consistent test results.

Enable the `TransitionGlobalConfig.skipAnimations` option to disable animations.

```ts
import { TransitionGlobalConfig } from "@optiaxiom/react";

// Do this in your global test setup file
TransitionGlobalConfig.skipAnimations = true;
```

### Cleanup toasts and dialogs

Toasts and managed dialogs are persisted globally which can cause tests to affect one another.

Use the `cleanup` method to clear out toasts and dialogs in your test setup/teardown hooks.

```ts
import { cleanup } from "@optiaxiom/react";

beforeEach(() => {
  cleanup();
});
```

## Jest

### Mock CSS imports

Jest does not support CSS imports by default and needs to be manually configured to handle them.

Install the `jest-transform-stub` package.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install -D jest-transform-stub
```

Stub CSS files by transforming them into empty modules in your Jest config file.

```js filename="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "\\.css$": "jest-transform-stub",
  },
};
```

## Vitest

### Process CSS imports

Vitest does not process CSS imports from within dependencies by default. So we have to manually configure it to bundle the Axiom dependencies:

```ts filename="vitest.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    server: {
      deps: {
        inline: ["@optiaxiom"],
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Cannot find 'react/jsx-runtime'

If you're using React 16 or 17 then running tests using Vitest will cause errors like this:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'react/jsx-runtime' imported from /node_modules/@optiaxiom/react/...
Did you mean to import "react/jsx-runtime.js"?
```

In order to fix this we have to manually configure it to bundle the Axiom dependencies:

```ts filename="vitest.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    server: {
      deps: {
        inline: ["@optiaxiom", "@radix"],
      },
    },
  },
});
```
