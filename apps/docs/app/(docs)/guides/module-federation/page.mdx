# Module Federation

Axiom supports Module Federation out of the box. But certain dependencies will need to be shared for components to work across multiple versions of Axiom on the same page.

## Configuration

### Shared dependencies

Please make sure `@optiaxiom/globals` and the following dependencies from **Radix UI** are marked to be shared between consumers and producers.

These shared dependencies are required for things like toasts, dialogs, and menus to work correctly across different versions of Axiom within the same page.

```ts
export default {
  shared: {
    "@optiaxiom/globals": {
      requiredVersion: "^1.0.0",
      singleton: true,
    },
    "@radix-ui/react-dismissable-layer": {
      requiredVersion: "^1.0.0",
      singleton: true,
    },
    "@radix-ui/react-focus-scope": {
      requiredVersion: "^1.0.0",
      singleton: true,
    },
    // ... other dependencies like react, react-dom, etc.
  },
};
```
