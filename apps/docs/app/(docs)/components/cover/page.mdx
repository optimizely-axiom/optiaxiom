# Cover

Use `Cover` to to expand and fill up the whole area of the parent which has `position: relative` using the `::before` pseudo element.

Combine this component with other interactive controls like `Checkbox`, `Link`, or `Button` to allow interacting with an element while also having nested controls inside that element.
