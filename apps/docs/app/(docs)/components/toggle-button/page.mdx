### Appearance

Use the `appearance` prop to select between the different button appearances.

<Demo component="toggle-button/appearance-usage" />

### Accessibility

When using icon only buttons please make sure to always include an `aria-label` prop for screen readers and optionally use tooltips to visually denote the button's intent.

<Demo component="toggle-button/tooltip-usage" />

### Disabled state

Set the `disabled` prop to `true` to disable buttons and prevent any interactions.

For accessibility please make sure to include text that explains why the button is disabled or use a tooltip.
