# Button

`Button` component is used to trigger actions.

## Documentation

### Usage

<Demo component={demos["button/usage"]} />

### Appearance

Use the `appearance` prop to select between the different button appearances.

<Demo component={demos["button/appearance-usage"]} />

### Different sizes

Use the `size` prop to modify the size of the button.

<Demo component={demos["button/size-usage"]} />

### Disabled state

Set the `disabled` prop to `true` to disable buttons and prevent any interactions.

For accessibility please make sure to include text that explains why the button is disabled or use a tooltip.

<Demo component={demos["button/disabled-usage"]} />

### Icons

Use the `icon` prop to add icons to a button.

#### Left and right icons

Icons are placed to the left by default but can be placed to the right using the `iconPosition` prop.

<Demo component={demos["button/icon-usage"]} />

#### Icon only button

Use the `icon` prop and omit the `children` to display an icon only button.

For accessibility please make sure to always include an `aria-label` prop for screen readers and optionally use tooltips to visually denote the button's intent.

<Demo component={demos["button/icon-only-usage"]} />

### Grouping buttons

Use the `<ButtonGroup />` component to group related buttons together.

<Demo component={demos["button/group-usage"]} />

### Links

#### Button as links

Set `asChild` to `true` and wrap children in an `<a>` element to render buttons as links.

<Demo component={demos["button/link-usage"]} />

#### Disabled button links

Make sure to prevent interactions manually using `event.preventDefault()` since `<a>` elements do not support the `disabled` prop.

Alternatively you can use our `Link` component which supports the `disabled` prop.

<Demo component={demos["button/link-disabled-usage"]} />

### Loading state

Set the `loading` prop to `true` to show a loading spinner and set `disabled` to `true` to prevent any interactions.

For accessibility please make sure to include text that explains why the button is disabled or use a tooltip.

<Demo component={demos["button/loading-usage"]} />

### File upload

We can create a simple file upload button by rendering the button as a `label` and including a visually hidden file input.

<Demo component={demos["button/file-upload-usage"]} />
